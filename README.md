# Complex Problem Solving Architecture

A problem is said to be a `complex problem` if input parameters are many and there is no simple solutions. The real-world problems are considered complex problems with a massive volume of data generated from sensors. 
There is no definite architecture based on artificial cognition and a reference architecture to solve generic complex problems can fill a huge gap. A reference architecture that can design, compose, and build complex problem of high complexity and solve them with various solvers is something highly desirable in the modern IoT-based world. 

This project is the `implementation code` of the proposed architecture for complex problem solving based on predictive optimization and task orchestration to deal with multi-objective problems. We define the modular approach of the architecture which aims to solve different problems with predictive, optimization, scheduling and control solvers. We design and develop a case study of microgrids complex problems of economy, cost and effective operation on top of the proposed architecture.
